Yes it could be much better but I'm lazy I just wanted to see how ox target worked but have fun with the script and please don't cry that it doesn't work it does work
i just added target

You need ox_lib
for the lib.showTextUI
don't you want a debug go to esx_vehicleshop\client\main and then ctrl G and type 846 and then you set debug to false


script with no target
